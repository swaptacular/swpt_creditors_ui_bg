# Swaptacular "Currency Holder UI" reference implementation

This project is a Bulgarian translation the [Payments Web
API](https://swaptacular.github.io/public/docs/swpt_creditors/redoc.html)
client for [Swaptacular]. It is a trivial fork of [the english
version](https://github.com/swaptacular/swpt_creditors_ui). The main
deliverable is a [docker image], generated from the project's
[Dockerfile](../master/Dockerfile). The generated image is a simple
static web server, running on port 80, which serves a [Progressive Web
App].

To obtain permissions to act on behalf of the user, the Web App
performs the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow] with Proof Key for
Code Exchange (PKCE), which is specifically designed for clients that
cannot securely store a client secret, because their entire source is
available to the browser.


## Configuration

The behavior of the running container can be tuned with environment
variables. Here are the most important settings with some random
example values:

```shell
# Set this to the name of your site, as it is known to your users. It
# should be short, and start with a captital letter. The default is
# "Swaptacular".
SITE_TITLE=Swaptacular

# If you want to recommend a website where your users can find
# currency issuers, set this to the URL of the website. The default is
# an empty string.
FIND_ISSUERS_URL=https://www.google.com/maps

# A number that will be shown to the users as the transaction fee in
# percents, collected for arranged automatic exchanges. The default is
# zero.
EXCHANGE_FEE=0.1

# If your creditors agent node performs automatic exchanges, then set
# these to the base currency's "debtor info locator" and "debtor ID".
# The defaults are an empty strings. (Note: In order to be traded,
# currencies must be pegged to other currencies, thus forming a
# "peg-tree". At the root of the peg-tree sits the "base currency".)
BASE_DEBTOR_INFO_LOCATOR=https://demo.swaptacular.org/debtors/5877400199/public
BASE_DEBTOR_ID=5877400199

# If your creditors agent node performs automatic exchanges, then set
# this to an amount that is at least 20% larger the MIN_TRADE_AMOUNT
# configured for the swpt_trade's solver. The default is 1200.
SMALL_TRADE_AMOUNT=1200

# The root path of the Web App. For example, when BASE_URL is
# "/wabapp", the Web App will be served at "/wabapp/". The default is
# "/". The value must start with a slash, and unless the value is "/",
# must not end with a slash.
BASE_URL=/wabapp

# An URL pointing to the "Redirect to the creditor's wallet"
# entrypoint on the server. (See the "Payments Web API"
# specification.)
SERVER_API_ENTRYPOINT=https://demo.swaptacular.org/creditors/.wallet

# OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow parameters.
AUTHORIZATION_URL=https://demo.swaptacular.org/oauth2/auth
TOKEN_URL=https://demo.swaptacular.org/oauth2/token
CLIENT_ID=creditors-webapp

# This must be the starting URL for the Web App, and it must exactly
# match the "redirect URL" that has been configured for the client
# with the given CLIENT_ID.
REDIRECT_URL=https://demo.swaptacular.org/creditors-webapp/
```

For more configuration options, check the
[app-config.env](../master/app-config.env) file.


## How to setup a development environment

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
installed.*

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd swpt_creditors_ui_bg
npm install
```

...then start [Vite](https://vitejs.dev):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see
your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload
the page to see your changes. You can edit the
[config.js](../master/public/config.js) file if you want to change the
active configuration options during development.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from
localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `dev`
command in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If
you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order
to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run serve`.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Each new version released in production, must have a
new value of the `cacheName` constant in the
[sw.js](../master/public/sw.js) file. This is necessary in order to
ensure that clients' service workers will be updated.**
